## Introduction

The Health Disease Predictor is a Flask web application that uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes and heart disease based on user-provided information.

## Features

- Diabetes prediction using a trained machine learning model.
- Heart disease prediction using a trained machine learning model.
- User-interface web interface for input and result display.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-disease-predictor.git
